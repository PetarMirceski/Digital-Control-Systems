# Digital-Control-Systems
Control Systems Project with Kalman Filter 
# Goal of the project
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge
in the field of image processing, digital control of proceses and 
implementation of implementing digital estimation on a given process.
The process chosen for this project is a ball on a beam. The goal 
is to control the position of the ball to be in the center of the beam.
